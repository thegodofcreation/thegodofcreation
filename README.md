- 👋 Hi, I’m @thegodofcreation
- 👀 I’m interested in Server Development, moderation and management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all different types of codes.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Server development I am sort of everywhere to be found.
- 📫 How to reach me 40s_family#0003 on discord.
- :thinking: Why should I be recruited? I have very good knowledge in commands/plugins. I have over 30 hours of availability per week and I am overall friendly.
